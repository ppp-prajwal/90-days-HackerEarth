Min Max Sum : Getting min and max sum of number in a list.
minSum = sum of array except last element(arr[len(arr)-1]) in a list.
maxSum = sum of array expect first element(arr[0]) in a list.

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.
Example: arr = [1 2 3 4 5]
The minimum sum is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and the maximum sum is 2+3+4+5 = 14. The function prints

Solution : 
def miniMaxSum(arr):
    # Write your code here
    arr.sort()
    arr_sum = 0
    arr_sum = sum(arr)
    max_sum = arr_sum - arr[0]
    min_sum = arr_sum - arr[len(arr)-1]
    print(min_sum, max_sum)

First approach : for loop from 0 to len-2 to get minSum in arr. for loop from 1 to len-1 to get maxSum in arr.
Second Approch : Use inbuilt function sum(arr). Subtract arr[0] from sum(arr) to get maxSum and arr[len(arr)-1] from sum(arr) to get minSum.

Points to remeber : First approach will take complexity of O(n) while second approach will tke complexity of O(1).
